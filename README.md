# Yield-Sync---Research-Project




#
## 🔍 Overview

This module is part of the YieldSync – Smart Farm Assistant project.
It helps farmers select the correct fertilizer type, estimate the expected yield per acre, and calculate the exact fertilizer quantity required for their field using real-time soil data and machine learning.

The system is designed for Sri Lankan agriculture and supports crops such as rice, beetroot, radish, and red onion, considering soil conditions and crop growth stages to improve productivity and reduce fertilizer misuse.

# 4) Crop Price & Demand Prediction (SELL / HOLD Decision)

## 🔍Overview
This module is part of the **Yield Sync – Smart Farm Assistant** project.
It helps farmers decide the best time to sell their crops by predicting

**SELL or HOLD** recommendation.

The system is designed for Sri Lankan agriculture and considers
**Maha and Yala seasons**, **festival periods**, and **weather-related trends**
to reduce crop wastage and improve farmer income.
