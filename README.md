# Yield-Sync---Research-Project
 ##🌱 IoT & ML Based Smart Fertilizer Recommendation System

 ## 📌 Overview

The IoT & ML Based Smart Fertilizer Recommendation System is a core module of the YieldSync – Smart Farm Assistant project.
This system helps farmers make data-driven fertilizer decisions by recommending the correct fertilizer type, predicting the expected yield per acre, and calculating the exact fertilizer quantity required based on field size.

The solution integrates real-time soil data collected using IoT sensors with machine learning models to reduce fertilizer misuse, lower production costs, improve soil health, and increase crop yield.
It is designed specifically for Sri Lankan agriculture and supports crops such as rice, beetroot, radish, and red onion, considering soil conditions and crop growth stages.
