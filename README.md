# Crop Price & Demand Prediction Module (SELL / HOLD Decision)

## Overview
This module is part of the **Yield Sync – Smart Farm Assistant** project.
It helps farmers decide the best time to sell their crops by predicting
future crop prices and market demand, and then providing a clear
**SELL or HOLD** recommendation.

The system is designed for Sri Lankan agriculture and considers
**Maha and Yala seasons**, **festival periods**, and **weather-related trends**
to reduce crop wastage and improve farmer income.

## Novelty

and converting these predictions into a **simple, actionable SELL or HOLD decision**
tailored for Sri Lankan farmers.
