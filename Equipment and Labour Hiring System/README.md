# Yield-Sync---Research-Project

# Location-Based Equipment & Labour Hiring System

## 🔍 Overview

This function is part of the **YieldSync – Smart Farm Assistant** project.  
It enables farmers to **search, match, and hire agricultural equipment and labour services** based on **location**, availability, and service needs through a centralized digital platform.

The function addresses common issues in Sri Lankan agriculture such as informal broker-based hiring, delays, lack of transparency, and unreliable service coordination by introducing a structured and traceable hiring workflow.

## ✨ Novelty

The novelty of this function lies in **combining equipment hiring and labour hiring into a single location-based system**, supported by availability management, booking confirmation, and post-service feedback, which is not present in traditional agricultural hiring practices.
